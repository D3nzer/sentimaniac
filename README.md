#### Code Examples and Explanations

**Data Loading and Cleaning:**
```python
import pandas as pd
import re
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# Load data
train_data = pd.read_csv("twitter_training.csv", encoding='utf-8', header=None)
train_data = train_data.dropna()

# Data cleaning
train_data["lower"] = train_data[1].str.lower()  # Lowercase conversion
train_data["lower"] = train_data["lower"].apply(lambda x: re.sub('[^A-Za-z0-9 ]+', ' ', x))  # Remove special characters
```

**Feature Extraction:**
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

# Initialize CountVectorizer
bow_counts = CountVectorizer(tokenizer=word_tokenize, stop_words=stopwords.words('english'))

# Transform data
X_train_bow = bow_counts.fit_transform(train_data["lower"])
```

**Model Training and Evaluation:**
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Train model
model = LogisticRegression(C=1, solver="liblinear", max_iter=150)
model.fit(X_train_bow, train_data['sentiment'])

# Evaluate model
test_pred = model.predict(X_test_bow)
print("Accuracy: ", accuracy_score(y_test_bow, test_pred) * 100)
```

### Section 3: Scientific "For Researchers"

#### Theoretical Aspects of the Project

Our project employs various theoretical concepts in machine learning, such as cross-validation and feature importance. Cross-validation allows us to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance more reliably by splitting the dataset into multiple training and testing sets, thus reducing overfitting and providing a more accurate measure of the modelâ€™s effectiveness.

#### Explanation of Used Models

We utilized logistic regression and XGBoost classifiers for sentiment analysis. Logistic regression is a simple yet powerful linear model used for binary classification, while XGBoost is a more advanced ensemble learning technique known for its high performance and efficiency in handling large datasets.

**Logistic Regression:**
Logistic regression models the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. It is widely used for its simplicity and interpretability.

**XGBoost:**
XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework, providing parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solves many data science problems in a fast and accurate way.

#### Feature Importance

Feature importance analysis helps us understand which variables have the most significant impact on the model's predictions. This is crucial for interpreting the model and improving its performance.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Train model to get feature importances
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier()
rf_model.fit(X_train_bow, y_train_bow)

# Get feature importances
importances = rf_model.feature_importances_
```

By focusing on the most important features, we can enhance the modelâ€™s accuracy and reduce computational costs.
